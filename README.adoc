Introduction
------------

This repository includes some example https://cmake.org/[CMake] configurations which I have picked up
when exploring it's usage for various projects.

CMake is a cross-platform open-source build system which can build, test and package
software. It can be used to support multiple native build environments including
make, Apple's xcode and Microsoft Visual Studio.

These examples have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 but should work under
any Linux system that supports CMake.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic requirements for most examples are:

* CMake
* A c++ compiler (defaults to gcc)
* make

The easiest way to install the above on Ubuntu is as follows

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
----

Some specific examples may require other tools including:

* http://www.boost.org/[boost]

  `$ sudo apt-get libboost-all-dev`

* https://github.com/google/protobuf[protobuf]

  `$ sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev`

* http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/[cppcheck]

  `$ sudo apt-get install cppcheck`
