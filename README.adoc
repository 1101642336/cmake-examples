--------------

This includes some example cmake configurations which I have picked up
when exploring it's usage for various projects.

These examples have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 but should work under
any Linux system that supports cmake.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic requirements for most examples are:

* CMake
* A c++ compiler (defaults to gcc)
* make

The easiest way to install the above on Ubuntu is as follows

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
---

Some specific examples may require other tools including:

* boost `$ sudo apt-get libboost-all-dev`
* protobuf `$ sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev`
* cppcheck `$ sudo apt-get install cppcheck`
